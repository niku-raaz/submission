I like learning new stuffs and have recently developed interest in competitive programming. I am a beginner in all the modules of this coding week, but have triend to learn WebDev, CP and Open Source. Despite these, I am learning cinematography.  

I actually really loved the concept of open source programming as it helps us to collaborate with others and take help from the pre-existing works. this really save our lot of efforts and time. And personally i would love to make games and there OpenSource will help me to a great extent. i can use the source code and modify it and make it the way i would love to play.
